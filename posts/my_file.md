# Welcome to My Automated Blog!

This is the content of my very first blog post, published directly from GitHub.
This demonstrates the power of automation.

## How I Did It

I used a GitHub Action to listen for changes in this repository.
When I push a new Markdown file to the `posts` directory, the action automatically
publishes it to my Hashnode blog.
